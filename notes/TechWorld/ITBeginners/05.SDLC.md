# Software Development Lifecycle

- Involves all roles mentioned in previous notes
- Programming: programming languages, dev teams per app or feature, write new functionality, fix bugs
- Testing: test new features, test old code/functionality, done by dev and dedicated testers, manual and automated testing
- Release: build application, run on servers, upgrade existing software, ops team, run software in prod

## Waterfall to Agile
- Methodology influences speed and process of software development
- Waterfall:
    - Requirements: plan everything beforehand
    - Development: code complete app
    - Testing: Testing after everything has developed
    - Operations: Prep infra, some back and forth with dev-testers, deploy
    - Ineffective process
    - Over time new requirements may arise
    - Many places of failure and miscommunication
    - No fast feedback
- Agile:
    - Pretty popular across organisations
    - Increases speed of dev, testing, and deployment cycles
    - Immediate feedback
    - Fast and flexible development and deployment process
    - Scrum and Kanban - specific implementations
    - Develop the app with continuous, short iterations
    - Teams cycle through a process of planning, executing and evaluating
    - Easier, faster and cheaper to make adjustments while development
    - Flexibility
    - Requirements, plans and results are evaluated continuosly
    - Enables the team to respond to customer's feedback quickly
- Scrum:
    - Implementation of Agile
    - 2-3 weeks iteration called sprints
    - Project management system
    - Goal is to build most important features first
    - Customer feedback into next sprints
    - Sprint planning kicks off the sprint
    - Prioritize the tasks
    - Backlog: flexible, prioritized list of tasks, regularly reviewed and cleaned up
    - Role - Scrum Master: 
        - Ensures scrum is done properly by the team, guides and facilitates, supports everyone in the scrum team

    - Role - Product Owner:
        - Represents customer and their needs
        - Intermediate
        - Translates the vision of the project to the team
        - Manages the product backlog
    - Role - Scrum Team:
        - Self organised group of people with different backgrounds: dev, ops, testers, designers..
        - Share responsibility for the sprint goals
        - Can make decisions to get work done
    - Role - Other stakeholders:
        - Management of company
        - Executive team members
        - Customer side
    - Jira: a tool that enables agile workflows like scrum
        - Can create backlog
        - Can create sprints
        - Visibility of tasks using sprint boards
