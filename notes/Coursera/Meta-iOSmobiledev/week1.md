## Mobile Platforms
## 1.7 What is a Mobile App?

- **Prevalence**: Mobile users surpass desktop users.
- **Mobile Website**: Specifically designed, developed, and optimized for mobile devices but doesn't take full advantage of the hardware.
- **Mobile Apps**: Installable software that utilizes both hardware and software to offer an intuitive and seamless user experience.
  - **Content-Driven**: A mobile website may suffice.
  - **Hardware-Dependent**: Requires a mobile app.
- **Advantages of Mobile Apps**:
  - Faster performance.
  - Access to device resources.
  - Functionality without internet access.
- **Disadvantages**:
  - More challenging to maintain.
  - Costlier to develop.
  - Platform-specific requirements (e.g., iOS, Android) necessitate approval.

## 1.8 Mobile Apps at Meta

- **Framework Development**: In-house developed frameworks and libraries for iOS mobile development to facilitate easy and rapid development, including open-source components like Component Kit.
- **Organization**: Structured by app level, then by features, with dedicated teams for iOS, Android, and web development to ensure consistency across platforms.
- **New Feature Development Process**:
  1. Set initial goals (e.g., growth, awareness, improvement, aesthetics, reliability).
  2. Brainstorming sessions with cross-functional partners.
  3. Roadmap development.
  4. Privacy reviews, scoping, and planning.
  5. Execution, tracking milestones, and addressing bugs.
  6. Experiment rollout and monitoring user response.
  7. Iteration based on feedback or learning from unsuccessful features.
  8. Gradual feature rollout, adhering to principles, tech stack, and design guidelines.
