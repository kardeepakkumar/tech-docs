    - Draw or stay

    - Refill and shuffle deck - Yes
    - scorekeeping
    - player can gamble any amount
    - win double, or lose all, or draw
    - dealer will play best, draw until exceed player

- Classes
    - Deck -> 52 cards -> each card has a value -> 2-9, 4*10, 1/11, could differentiate between J/Q/K/10, and suite but not necessary -> draw/refill/shuffle deck
    - player class -> Player/Dealer subclasses -> will have a hand -> makeMove (different for player/dealer) -> placeBet for player
    - GameRound -> win/draw/loss -> decide on ending game -> play() -> pass on a player+dealer+deck
