# SQL

- Primary ways we store data: databases
- Standard Query Language
- SQL: a major component of RDBMS, other is NoSQL
- RDBMS: Relational database management system
- SQL: Access data stored in RDBMS
- RDBMS is stored on disk: we want persistance
- Data structure for RDBMS is B+ Tree: an m way tree, each node has m-1 key-values, siblings are connected as linked lists, we key by a chosen index
- There are bunch of tables
- Tables have a schema:
```
CREATE TABLE People(
    PhoneNumber int,
    Name varchar(100)
);
```
- Records in a table: the rows satisfies the schema
- Tables can have relationships
- We could have rules: constraints
- We could have rules from other tables as well: Foreign key constraints
- Every table needs to have a way to uniquely identify every row in a table: Primary key
- Choose one or more columns for primary key
- We could perform joins: join tables
```
SELECT People.name, Homes.address,
FROM People, Homes,
WHERE People.phone = Homes.phone;
```
- ACID:
    - Atomicity: Every DB transaction is all or nothing, transactions are treated atomically
    - Consistency: Columns could have constraints, defined rules are followed. Foreign key constraints can be expensive
    - Isolation: Multiple concurrent transactions happen, but are serialised to prevent phantom/dirty/etc.. reads
    - Durability: Use disk, persistent, committed transactions should be durable
- Transactions: more than just a query, could be collections
    - begin
    - select
    - insert
    - select
    - update
    - commit
