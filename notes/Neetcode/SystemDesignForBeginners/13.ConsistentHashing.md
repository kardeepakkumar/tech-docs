# Consistent Hashing

- Use some kind of hashing function to route traffic to the servers in LB
- Hash key and a hash function(SHA) which consistenly maps a user to a server node
- Consistent behavior due to hash function behavior
- Some type of redis inmemory caching could be used for repeat users
- Removing a server could break the hash mapping: will have to be routed balanced to other servers. Evenly redistributing would waste existing cache.
- More optimisations when adding and removing servers to uniformly distribute traffic and minimize cache loss
- Used in CDNs, database nodes
- Rendezvous Hashing: consistent Hashing is about nC1, rendezvous hashing is about nCk
