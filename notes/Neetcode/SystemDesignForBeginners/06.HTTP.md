# HTTP

- HTTP is an application layer protocol
- Client Server model
    - Client is generally some sort of end user: desktop, laptop, browser
    - Client makes request to the server, and expects a response back
    - Client is a general term used for request initiator, not neccessarily an end user
    - So, client itself could be a server, which acts as a client for another server
- RPC: Remote Procedure Call
    - Way multiple machines talk remotely over a network
    - Remote means machines separated by a network
    - Loose definition: We want to run a code which is on server -> RPC
    - All application protocols are essentially RPCs at their core
    - Eg: Client makes listVideos() and the server runs this and responds
- HTTP: Hyper Text Transfer Protocol
    - IP/TCP combo: reliably transfer data
    - HTTP is on top of IP/TCP
    - HTTP is a request response protocol
    - Client initiates the request
    - Request defines what code we are trying to run on the server
    - There are multiple versions of http, like h3
    - Every HTTP request has a header and a body
    - General header: url, request method: GET/PUT/POST/DELETE, Status Code: 200/404, Referrer Policy: cors
    - Request Headers: what client sets in the request: authority, method, path, accept(options for content-type)
    - Response Headers: content-type which was returned
    - Payload: Body of the request
- Methods: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE: CRUD
    - http://youtube.com : This is an API route, which could serve multiple http methods
    - Route with a particular method is called an endpoint
    - Same route with different methods could have a different functionality: a new endpoint
    - GET: typically used to retrieve some information. GET request don't have a body. Idempotent.
    - POST: creating a resource on the server
    - PUT: similar to POST, but more like an update rather than create
- Status Code:
    - Informational responses: 100-199
    - Successful responses: 200-200
    - Redirection messages: 300-300
    - Client error responses: 400- 499
    - Server error responses: 500-599
    - Some common ones: 200->OK, 201->Created, 400->BadRequest, 401->Unauthorised, 404->NotFound, 500->InternalServiceError, 502-> BadGateway, 503->ServiceUnavailable
- SSL/TLS:
    - HTTPS: S -> Secure
    - HTTPS: HTTP with SSL
    - TLS is more widely used and recent than SSL
    - HTTPS prevents man in the middle attacks to some extent
    - SSL/TLS encrypts any data sent over HTTP
    - Server decrypts the data
