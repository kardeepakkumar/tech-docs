# Networking Basics

- How do 2 computers communicate?
- We need to know the address
- Need a public IP address which uniquely identifies 
- IPv4 Address: 32 bits (4 billion), written as 000.000.000.000 to 256.256.256.256
- IPv6 Address: 128 bits
- We need a From and To address in real world mail. Similarly, we need a protocol for computer communications.
- Rules of sending data over Internet: IP: Internet Protocol
- Data unit that we send over is called a packet
- Portion of packet is reserved for the metadata: header: source IP, destination IP, etc.
- Split large data into small packets, send over
- Use TCP: Trasmission control protocol, to reassemble the split data
- TCP: further header in the data of the IP packet, it will include the sequence number
- The TCP data section will contain the application data, say HTTP data
- Different protocols operate at different layers of the network
- For a server to be publicly accessible, it needs to have a public IP address
- If we have a public IP router, that will serve the public IP address needs and internally address a private address to each machine connected to it
- Static IP Addresses do not change - eg server side IP address needs to be constant, but dynamic DNS can be used
- Dynamic IP Addresses does change dunamically
- Ports: channel of communication between machines, 22, 80, 443, etc.
- Ports: 2^16 ~ 65,000: usually enough
- Many application layer protocols have default protocols, eg: HTTP 80, HTTPS 443
- localhost = 127.0.0.1, reserved IP address points to local machine
- We can only run a single application on a port at a time
