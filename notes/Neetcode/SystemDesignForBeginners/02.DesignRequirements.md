# Design Requirements

- Need to weigh tradeoffs
- We always either Move/Store/Transform Data
- Moving data from one component to another, or from one machine to another across a server
- Storing data: consider that RAM is temporary while disk persists
- Usually storing on DB, Blob store, file systems, or distributed file systems. They have tradeoffs.
- Transform example: logs aggregation
- Typically, app code transforms data
- Bad design choices are typically hard to correct later. Eg: database migration and rewrite code portions.
- Good design
```
availability = uptime/(uptime+downtime)
23/24 hr ~ 96% availability
```
- Theoretically, 100% is impossible. We usually maxout at 5-9s
- SLOs: Service Level Objectives, some internal availability requirement
- SLAs: Service Level Agreement, agreed availability with consequences upon failure
- SLOs are more strict than SLAs
- Reliability: Probability of system not failing, not usually defined quantitatively
- Fault Tolerance: System continues to operate even when one portion of system fails
- Redundancy: Unneccessary copy, usually in another geographical location
- Throughput: Amount of operations we can handle per unit time ~ requests/second (relevant for users), queries/second (qps for db), bytes/second (relevant for data pipelines)
- Limitations of vertical scaling: hardware limitations, single point of failure
- Horizontally scaling a database is challenging, handling distributed databases in sync
- Latency: Amount of time for an operation to complete, could be caused by network. Locating servers to nearby users ~ Content Delivery Networks CDNs
