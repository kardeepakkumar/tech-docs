# Application Architecture

- High level architecture for a production app
- Developers write code which gets built and deployed on some server. Some kind of persistent storage is required
- User needs to communicate to the app, example: from the browser
- If slow, need to identify the bottleneck: CPU, RAM, disk..
- If we upgrade a single server's resources, its called vertical scaling
- Vertical scaling is not always feasible, it has a limitation
- Horizontal scaling: Have more copies of our servers running our code, user requests will be distributed
- Load Balancer: handles request forwarding to the different servers in a balanced way
- Servers could be talking to other servers
- External logging service, where app logs all logs, and dev can interact, typically time series data
- Metrics service: How is our server running? App or resource metrics, eg: log based metrics
- Alerting service: Push notification for thresholding metrics
- Networking: all the components need to connect
