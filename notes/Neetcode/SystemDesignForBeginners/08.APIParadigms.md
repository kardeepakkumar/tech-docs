# API Paradigms

- Application Programming Interface: General term, loosely defined
- Local storage: Stored on a web browser. An API is used to access the local storage.
- In OOP, we create methods to access data of object is technically an API
- Commonly though, API is used to refer to external service like an HTTP API
- Most popular API paradigms: REST, GraphQL, gRPC
- REST
    - Most common
    - Representation State Transfer
    - Not a protocol
    - Built on top of HTTP
    - Set of standardisations applied to HTTP API
    - HTTP APIs has become synonymous with REST in common term usage, though technically not
    - REST API is associated with a resource, like video for a youtube GET REST API
    - REST API is stateless, no state stored in server, but persistent storage in DB and local storage is still okay
    - Request itself has all information we need, we could use pagination/offset parameter in the url for example
    - Why stateless? - We can have multiple servers, and each could randomly be assigned a new session: Horizontal scaling feasible
    - It has the GET, POST, PUT and all that
    - JSON(Javascript Object Notation) is a popular data format for REST API, human readable key value pairs
- GraphQL
    - Relatively New
    - Created by facebook
    - Only uses HTTP POST request
    - In POST request body, we refer which resources we want from the server
    - Accessing resources from a complex server using REST APIs, we are going to be overfetching/underfetching
    - In GraphQL: For every single resource, we can specify which fields we want(from a schema), very flexible
    - We only need a single endpoint with GraphQL
    - Two types of operation: Query (aka reading), Mutation
    - Downside is we can't cache graphQL as its only POST requests
- gRPC
    - Created in 2016, by google
    - google Remote Procedure Calls
    - Newer, not much standardised, not many toolings
    - Built on HTTP/2
    - Cannot be used natively from a browser, need a proxy
    - gRPC web is used as proxy
    - gRPC is typically used for server to server communication
    - Performance wise objectively faster than REST APIs
    - gRPC sends info in protocol buffers instead of json
    - Protocol Buffers are schema objects, which are serialised in binary
    - Protocol buffer can be converted to object to different programming languages
    - In gRPC, we are sending smaller data
    - JSON is not a schemma
    - gRPC offers uni/bidirectional streaming
