# CAP Theorem

- Consistency: Means data is updated between the DB nodes
- Availability: Every single node responds to valid request
- Partition Tolerance: System continues to function even if there is some network break between DB nodes
- It applies sensibly to distributed databases
- Misunderstood that we can choose 2 out of 3, but P is guaranteed and we choose C/A
- If there is some partition in network, then we can only have consistency or availability (tradeoffs)

- PACELC: Given P, choose A or C. Else, favor latency or consistency.
