- All objects are stored non heirarchically. Folder structure in cloud providers is part of name only.
- Object means blob: Binary Large Object

- Can't update an object
- Optimsed to store large amount of objects in a flat way
- S3 requires a globally unique bucket name
- Interface for S3 is http, make a network request to S3
- Use filename and hashing to find the objects
