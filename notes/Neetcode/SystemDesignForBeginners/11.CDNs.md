# Content Delivery Network (CDN)

- Cache data closer to end users using CDN
- Bunch of servers distributed around the world
- One origin, and many CDNs
- We could have 100s or 1000s of CDNs around the world
- We can't put everything on CDNs
- We put static content on CDNs
- New edge servers allow to run code as well, similar to CDNs
- Static js, images, videos etc.. could be stored on CDNs
- Decrease latency and increase availability
- Push CDN: As change happens in origin, push it to all CDNs
- Pull CDN: Check CDN server, if required data not cached, CDN acts as proxy to pull data. Next times will be cache HITs. Useful when there is regional discrimation on data requests
- Cache control: public -> allowed to cache this data on other servers, besides the local storage for example
