# API Design

- API Paradigms describes how we are going to use a particular API: surface area
- API design is about coding in general: input/ouput
- API request with its body makes the whole request
- API parameters can be optional to cater multipurpose use
- Most APIs will have some kind of version associated with it, many being active
- Different versions could have slightly different behaviors
- Pagination is handled by typically two query parameters: limit and offset
- limit and offset are usually optional with default values
- Example GET API url: https://api.twitter.com/v1.0/users/:id/tweets?limit=10&offset=0
- base path + "users" resource + id of resource + "tweets" resource + query parameters
- GET API is idempotent, doesn't change state of any resources: useful for caching
- Public APIs need good documentation
- Refer: Stripe/Twitter API docs
