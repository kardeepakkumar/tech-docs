# NoSQL

- NoSQL: Not Only SQL
- NoSQL is for non relational db
- Tradeoffs between relational and non relational
- Example: key value store: Redis, memcached, etcd, Uniqid->flatInfo: simple scenario, lot of data read quickly
- Usually key value store used as cache for something else
- Document store: collection of documents (like a json: nested key-value pairs): primary key -> document object. Lot more flexible, no schema required.
- Popular open source document NoSQL DB: MongoDB
- Wide column: handle massive scale, oriented for lots of write over read/update, sometimes we use schema: Cassandra, Google BigTable
- GraphDB: all about relations, complex social media relations
- NoSQL scale up more than RDB : sacrificing ACID improves scalability
- Hard to scale RDB horizontally: routing, joins become complex
- Simple scale NoSQL horizontally
- NoSQL follow BaSE: Eventual Consistency: Replicas are synchronised using leader-followers mechanisms
- Replicas enable much higher read capacity
- SQL databases can be replicated using sharding
