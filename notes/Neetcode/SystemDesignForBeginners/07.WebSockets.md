- Limitations of HTTP
    - Need to poll for updating data
    - HTTP2 does support streaming, but websockets more prevalent
- Web Socket
    - First, we do a web socket handshake/connection: 101 response -> upgraded to websocket
    - HTTP is discrete messages
    - With web sockets, we can send data in either direction constantly
    - Immediately recieve server pushed messages
