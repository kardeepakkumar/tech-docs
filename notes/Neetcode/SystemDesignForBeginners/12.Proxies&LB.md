# Proxies and Load Balancers

- Forward Proxy 
    - usually by default proxy means forward
    - We have a middle server in between which forwards it to actual server on behalf, it will act as user
    - Hides client from destination server
    - Could be used when something within your network is not allowed to directly speak to the destination server, so use proxy server in between
    - On a school/corporate network, all communications could go through a proxy and filters/blocks could be set
    - a VPN is a proxy, could pretend you're from a different country
- Reverse Proxy
    - A reverse proxy hides the destination server instead of client
    - Client may not even know about the existence of the destination server, it just knows the reverse proxy server
    - CDN is sort of a reverse proxy
    - A load balancer is also a reverse proxy
- Load Balancer
    - A type of reverse proxy
    - User request hit load balancer first, and then balanced into multiple servers
    - There are many algorithms to distribute the load: round robin, weighted round robin, least connections, location, hashing, etc.
    - Layer 4: TCP layer, faster as we just look at IP, less flexible, less info
    - Layer 7: Application Layer, HTTP, could differentiate based on application logic
    - Multiple/Backup LBs are sometimes setup for higher availability
    - Generally LBs can handle very high traffic, as they just route traffic
    - nginx: popular open source load balancer
    - aws/gcp provide out of box LBs as well
