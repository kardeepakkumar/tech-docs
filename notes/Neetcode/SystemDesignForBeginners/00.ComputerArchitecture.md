# Computer Architecture

- Understand Computer's design at a high level
- Main components of a computer from a software perspective
1. Storage/Disk/Hard Drive/HDD/SSD: Store all of our data persistently, read/write ~ milliseconds
1.  RAM: Random Access Memory: Storing information, typically lot smaller than disk, more expensive moneywise, time cost efficient for read/write ~ microseconds, not persistent
1. CPU: Central Processing Unit: Read/Write info on RAM/Disk, executes code which is in RAM, CPUs have cache ~ MBs for superfast r/w ~ nanoseconds, subset of RAM stored in cache, very expensive moneywise, not persistent
1. Distributed Systems use the above setup as a building block
1. Hardware limitations force us to use distributed computing. Eg: in last 10 yrs CPU speed is plateauing
