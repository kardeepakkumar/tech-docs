# TCP and UDP

- Transport Layer Protocols
- TCP/IP : aka internet protocol suite: TCP is encapsulated in IP packet
- TCP much more common than UDP
- TCP enables the sequencing of data
- TCP is reliable, UDP is not
- TCP handles missing data by triggering retransmission for the lost packets
- TCP: establishes a connection between the communicating machines
- TCP uses an expensive 3 way handshake to establish connection: SYN -> SYN/ACK -> ACK
- Most application protocols run on top of TCP: HTTP, SMTP, WS
- UDP: User Datagram(aka packet) Protocol
- UDP doesn't need established connection, so no handshake required
- Some packets may get lost in UDP
- UDP doesn't handle ordering
- UDP is lot faster than TCP
- UDP example: streaming data: video, call, online gaming, DNS
