# Message Queues

- If we have large and fast amount of app events, more than our app server can handle at once, we put them in message queue, to be handled asynchronously
- Messages in message queue are durable aka persistent
- Event producer and event processor are decoupled
- Usually FIFO
- Server could periodically pull from the message queue
- Queue can push messages to the server, if unable to process (unacked) -> try again
- Pub/Sub variation of message queuing
    - Publisher subscriber
    - Event producers are publishers
    - Event receivers are subscribers
    - Events are published to topics: which receive and store the events
    - Topics will feed into subscriptions
    - Many to Many message queuing implemented
    - Decouple application from the messages combination
- RabbitMQ and Kafka are popular ones
