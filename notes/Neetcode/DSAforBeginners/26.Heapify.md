# Heapify

- Trivial way of pushing n items into a Min/Max Heap ~ O(nlogn)
- But we have special algorithm: Heapify/BuildHeap
- We can simply create a structured heap in O(n) time
- For ordering, first, we note that last half of nodes don't have children
- Then, for each node we percolate down swapping
- Generally percolating down is more efficient than percolating up
- Time complexity of ordering is O(n)
```
T = (0*n/2) + (1*n/4) + ... + (logn * 1)
T = n/4 * sum(k/(2^(k-1)) for k in range(1, logn + 1))
T ~ O(n)
```
```python
def heapify(self, arr):
    arr.append(arr[0])
    self.heap = arr
    
    curr = (len(self.heap)-1)//2
    while curr > 0:
        # percolate down
        i = curr
        while(2*i < len(self.heap)):
            if(2*i + 1 < len(self.heap) and
            self.heap[2*i + 1] < self.heap[2*i] and 
            self.heap[i] < self.heap[2*i + 1]):
                tmp = self.heap[i]
                self.heap[i] = self.heap[2*i + 1]
                self.heap[2*i + 1] = tmp
                i = 2*i + 1
            elif(self.heap[2*i] < self.heap[i]):
                tmp = self.heap[i]
                self.heap[i] = self.heap[2*i]
                self.heap[2*i] = tmp
                i = 2*i
            else:
                break
        curr -= 1
```
- We can heapify and pop as a sorting method: O(nlogn)
- Downside of heap: we cannot search heap for an element efficiently, so O(n)
- Often, heaps are used as utility in many algorithms
