# Search Array

## Binary Search
- It works on already sorted array
- It is a divide and conquer algorithm
- Worst case of any search is O(n)
- Binary search is time O(log n)
- Space complexity is O(1)
- Reduce search space by half at each iteration
```python
def binarySearch(arr, x):
    low = 0
    high = len(arr) - 1
    while low <= high:
        mid = (high + low) // 2
        if arr[mid] < x:
            low = mid + 1
        elif arr[mid] > x:
            high = mid - 1
        else:
            return mid
    return -1
```
