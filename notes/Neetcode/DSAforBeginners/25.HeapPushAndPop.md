# Heap Push and Pop

- Inserting/Pushing into a heap
- Push at end of array, and swap with parent recursively until order property is satisfied, or root is reached
- Time Complexity of pushing is O(logn), heap tree is balanced anyways
```python
class Heap:
    def __init__(self):
        self.heap = []
    def push(self, val):
        self.heap.append(val)
        i = len(self.heap) - 1
        # Percolate up
        while self.heap[i] < self.heap[i//2]:
            tmp = self.heap[i]
            self.heap[i] = self.heap[i//2
            self.heap[i//2] = tmp
            i = i//2
```
- Priority Queue is about popping the root, the priority element
- Reading priority element is O(1)
- Remove the root element, and replace it with last element
- Then swap with the smaller child until order property is satisfied or leaf is reached
- Time complexity of popping is O(logn)
```python
def pop(self):
    if len(self.heap) == 1:
        return None
    if len(self.heap) == 2:
        return self.heap.pop()
        
    res = self.heap[1]
    # Move last value to root
    self.heap[1] = self.heap.pop()
    # percolate down
    i = 1
    while(2*i < len(self.heap):
        if(2*i + 1 < len(self.heap) and
        self.heap[2*i + 1] < self.heap[2*i] and
        self.heap[2*i + 1] < self.heap[i]):
            # swap with right child
            tmp = self.heap[i]
            self.heap[i] = self.heap[2*i + 1]
            self.heap[2*i +1] = tmp
            i = 2*i + 1
        elif(self.heap[2*i] < self.heap[i]):
            # swap with left child
            tmp = self.heap[i]
            self.heap[i] = self.heap[2*i]
            self.heap[2*i] = tmp
            i = 2*i
        else:
            break
    return res
```
