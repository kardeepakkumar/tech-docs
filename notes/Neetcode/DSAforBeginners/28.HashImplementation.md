# Hash Implementation

- HashMaps are implemented with an array
- We use an index, mapped with key-value pair
- Size of empty hashmap is not empty
- We need a way to convert the key into an integer
- How we do this conversion is called Hashing
- We use a Hashing function to do this f_hashing(key) -> int % len(arr) -> index
- Multiple keys could end up mapping to same index -> called collission
- To minimise collissions, we track size and availibility
- We keep roughly atleast half of hash array empty, by doubling it each time half is full
- After resizing, need to remap existing keys to new indices
- This process is called rehashing the array
- Rehashing is pretty expensive but infrequent, so average is not affected much
- Collissions may be minimised but not completely avoided
- Multiple ways of collissions mitigations
- Chaining: Instead of single key-pair at each index, we instead store a linked list of key-value pair
- Open Addressing: Just try the next position if hashed position is occupied
- Usually, the size of array is set as a prime number, and then roughly doubled to another prime. This helps reduce collissions
