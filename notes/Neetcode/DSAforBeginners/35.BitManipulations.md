# Bit Manipulations

- Bits are 0s and 1s
- Operations: AND (&), OR (|), XOR (^), NOT, Bit shifting
```python
# AND
n = 1 & 1

# OR
n = 1 | 0

# XOR
n = 0 ^ 1

# Bit shifting
n = 1
n = n << 1 # Left shift ~doubled
n = n >> 1 # Right shift ~halved
```
- If we bit shift beyond the limit of the variable data type size either side, we could get a zero
```python
# Counting Bits
def countBits(n):
    count = 0
    while n > 0:
        if n&1 == 1:
            count +=1
        n = n>> 1
    return count
```
