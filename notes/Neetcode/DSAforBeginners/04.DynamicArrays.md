# Dynamic Arrays

- Much more common and useful than static arrays
- Python and JS: default is dynamic arrays
- Python: myArr = []
- JavaScript: const myArr = [];
- Java: List<Integer> myArr = new ArrayList<Integer>();
- C++: vector<int> myArr;
- Problem is the fixed size of static arrays
- In static arrays, we specify the size while creating. Or default size.
- In dynamic array, internally a pointer is kept for last index of the array
- Pushing and popping: Adding and removing at the end of the array: O(1)
- If memory is full, or next memory item is not available, then a new memory block (say double size) is allocated and the old memory block is freed (de-allocated by the OS): O(n)
- O(n), is why we double it. Tradeoff between O(n) and empty unused space
- Amortized (average) Time Complexity of pushing a value to a dynamic array ~O(1)
- Pushing n items into an array ~O(n): yt's about O(2n), but we don't care about c in O(c*f(n)) or O(c+f(n))
- Inserting and removing in the middle is still O(n)
