# Bucket Sort

- It can run in O(n), even in the worst case!
- Very rarely used because of constraints
- If we know the range of the array, we can use Bucket Sort
- Bucket Sort is useful for sorting arrays with a small range of values
- We are gonna have a bucket for each value in the range
- We will go over each element in the array, and increase the count of the bucket it belongs to
- Space Complexity: O(1), given unique values are small range
- Bucket Sort is unstable
```python
def bucketsort(arr):
    counts = [0]*(range of arr values)
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        counts[arr[i]] += 1
    arr = []
    for key in counts.keys():
        arr += [key]*counts[key]
    return arr
```
