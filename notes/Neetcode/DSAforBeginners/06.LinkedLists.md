# Linked Lists

- Made up of ListNode: Object with atleast 2 things:
  - Value
  - Next pointer: tells us what is the next ListNode in the linked list
- By default Next is empty/null
- Next is reference to another ListNode
- Eg: ListNode1.next = ListNode2 (address of the ListNode2 is stored, programmatically we simply use the reference)
- Need not be ordered in memory
- How to loop through from beginning (Last pointer will be pointing to null):
```python
cur = ListNode1
while(cur! = None):
  cur = cur.next
```
- Traversing a linked list: Time Complexity: O(n)
- We keep track of head and tail of a linkedlist
- We can use the tail pointer to conveniently add a new node in the linked list: O(1)
```
tail.next = NewListNode
tail = NewListNode # or tail = tail.next
```
- Removing node is O(1) if we have previous node pointer handy

```head.next = head.next.next #removing second node```
  - We can free up the memory, or language's garbage collection does it on its own
  - Practically, removing element is O(n) as we have to search for it by traversing the linked list from head
