# RAM

What is a Data Structure?
Structuring data in RAM(aka memory)

- RAM is basically where all of our variables will be stored
- RAM is measured in bytes: say GB ~10^9 bytes
- 1 Byte = 8 bits
- 1 bit = 0/1
- RAM is a contiguous block of data
- Values stored at address
- We don't get to choose which location in RAM
- Arrays are stored contiguously though

Example:
- The array will be stored in RAM
- [1,3,5] -> 4 byte integer -> Address: $0, $4, $8
- ['a', 'b', 'c'] -> 1 byte ASCII chars -> Address: $0, $1, $2
