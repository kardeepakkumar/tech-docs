# BST Sets and Maps

- Sets and Maps are data structures which are commonly implemented using BSTs
- Search, Insert and Remove in set implemented using BST in O(logn)
- Maps example: in a phonebook, names are mapped with phone numbers
- Maps: Key-value pairing, and typically sorted by the keys
- In BST, each node will have a key, and associated value object
- Hashmaps and hashsets are implemented using other techniques
- BST implementations are typically called Ordered sets, tree sets, ordered maps, tree maps
```python
from sortedcontainers import SortedDict
treeMap = SortedDict({'c': 3, 'a': 1, 'b': 2})
```
- Features of treemap: insert, remove, search, iterate, inorder and other traversals
- Know their time complexities
