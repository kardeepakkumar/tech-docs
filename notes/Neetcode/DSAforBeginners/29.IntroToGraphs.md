# Introduction to Graphs

- Really common topic in coding interviews
- Linked Lists and Trees are a subset of Graphs
- A Graph is made up of nodes and pointers connecting the nodes, called vertices and edges
- We could have graphs of all kinds of shapes, can have cycles, can be uni or bidirectional
- Always Number of Edges <= (Number of Vertices)^2
- We can have an edge going in on itself
- We usually don't have duplicate edges in graphs
- Directed graphs means the edges have directions
- Undirected graphs means the edges don't have directions
- 3 common ways of graphs: Matrix, Adjacency Matrix, Adjacency List

## Matrix
- Its a 2D array
- Can be used to represent a graph
- grid[1] represents row 1
- grid[1][2] represents element in row1, col2
- We could mark 0 for free, or 1 for blocked
- We could define move left, right, up, down. And the 0s together could create the undirected graph

## Adjacency Matrix
- Not as common than the other 2 examples
- Typically a squared matrix of size V*V
- adj[v1][v2] = 1, an edge exists from v1 to v2
- adj[v2][v1] = 1, an edge exists from v2 to v1
- adj[v1][v2] = 0, an edge doesn't exist from v1 to v2
- Space Complexity is O(V^2)

## Adjacency List
```python
class GraphNode:
    def __init__(self, val):
        self.val = val
        self.neighbors = []
```
- We could have any number of pointers, not just next/prev or left/right, so we use list of pointers
- List of neighbor graph nodes
- Neighbor would mean outgoing edges
- For undirected graphs, connected vertices would have each other in their neighbors list
