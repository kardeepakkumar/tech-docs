# Stacks

- Typically supports 3 operations:
  - Push at the end: O(1)
  - Pop the last element: O(1)
  - Peek/Top the last element: O(1)
- Dynamic arrays satisfies the requirements of a stack
- We can use dynamic array to implement a stack
- Elements can be removed in reversed order of elements inserted
- LIFO: Last In, First Out
