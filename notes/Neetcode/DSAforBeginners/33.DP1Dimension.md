# 1-Dimension Dynamic Programming

- Typically, convert a recursion problem into DP
- Example: Fibonacci
- In DP, the idea is to avoid repeated calculations
```python
# Memoization
def memoization(n, cache):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    if n in cache:
        return cache[n]
    
    cache[n] = memoization(n-1) + memoization(n-2)
    return cache[n]
print(memoization(5, {}))
```
- Above is a top down dp approach
- Fibonacci time complexity from O(2^N) to O(N)
- In bottom up approach, we can't directly convert from recursion
```python
# Dynamic Programming
def dp(n):
    if n < 2:
        return n
    dp = [0,1]
    i = 2
    while i <= n:
        tmp = dp[1]
        dp[1] = dp[0] + dp[1]
        dp[0] = tmp
        i += 1
    return dp[1]
```
- Time complexity is still O(n)
