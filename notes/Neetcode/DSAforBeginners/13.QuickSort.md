# Quick Sort

- Similar to merge sort
- We pick a pivot: typically right most
- Divide and conquer
- We iterate through every item left of pivot
  - Less than pivot: move to left subpartition
  - Greater than pivot: move to right subpartition
- Can do partition in place
- 2 pointers:
  - One for iterating through the array: comparison pointer
  - One for putting in the array: position pointer
- Swap the items in place
- Put the pivot element at the last position pointer
- Pivot is in the final sorted position
- Recursively run the algorithm on the left and right subpartitions
- Base case: when the array is of size 1
- No extra memory for arrays, in place swapping
- Average Time complexity: O(n log n)
- Worst Time complexity: O(n^2)
- Best Time complexity: O(n log n)
- Average Space complexity: O(log n)
- Worst Space complexity: O(n)
- One way to check first, middle and last index values, and choose the middle value as pivot
```python
def quickSort(arr, start, end):
   if (end - start + 1) <= 1:
     return arr
   pivot = arr[end]
   left = start
   for i in range(start, end):
     if arr[i] < pivot:
       tmp = arr[i]
       arr[left] = arr[i]
       arr[i] = tmp
       left += 1
   arr[end] = arr[left]
   arr[left] = pivot
   quickSort(arr, start, left - 1)
   quickSort(arr, left + 1, end)
   return arr
```
-    Is quicksort stable? Generally, no. Because of swappings, order could change
-    Better than insertion sort
