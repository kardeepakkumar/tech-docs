# Breadth First Search

- These traversals can be applied to any tree, not neccassarily BST
- In BFS, we traverse the tree layer by layer
- Also called level order traversal
- We are gonna need a FIFO data structure, queues will be useful
- deque is a double ended queue in python
```python
from collections import deque
def bfs(root):
    queue = deque()
    if root:
        queue.append(root)
    level = 0
    while len(queue) > 0:
        print("level: ", level)
        for i in range(len(queue)): #This takes a snapshot of len(queue)
            curr = queue.popleft()
            print(curr.val)
            if curr.left:
                queue.append(curr.left)
            if curr.right:
                queue.append(curr.right)
        level += 1
```
- Each node is visited only once, time complexity is O(n)
- DFS and BFS are both very commonly used algorithms
