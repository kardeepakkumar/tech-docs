# Static Arrays

## Properties of array
- Contiguous block of data
- Stored so in RAM
- Any data structure -> important operations -> reading/writing
- Say we have a variable 'myArray' -> stored in RAM
- Reading
  - Programming side: use indices to refer the position in the array
  - Indices usually start at 0, and increase by 1: i = 0,1,...n-1
  - Index is mapped to address automatically
  - Go in memory and read the value at the address
  - Can instantly read any value in array: O(1)
  - Property of RAM to Randomly Access any portion of Memory in the RAM, given the address
  - In most languages, we use for and while to loop through an array's indices
- Writing
  - Static arrays are of fixed size: biggest limitation
  - Can we add a new item in the array?
    - Next position may not be available
    - If we put anywhere, RAM occupation won't be contiguous
  - Languages like python and js don't offer static arrays, they offer dynamic arrays as default
  - By default, languages will initialise an array with 0s, or with random values
  - We can add values in array -> put in memory
  - We can remove values in static array -> eg: just overwrite by 0 -> but address still occupied in memory: O(1)
  - Adding a value at a position is an instant time operation: O(1)
  - Insert in middle of array?
    - Inserting at end is efficient(if available): O(1)
    - Order of the values does matter
    - For adding in middle, have to shift it all the way till end: O(n), where n = len(array)
    - length of array != size of array, occupied vs reserved
    - Big O means the worst case
  - Removing an element in middle
    - Shift to the left
    - O(n)
    - Removing at the end: O(1)
