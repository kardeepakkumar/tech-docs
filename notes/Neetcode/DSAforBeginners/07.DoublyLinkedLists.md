# Doubly Linked Lists

- We have 2 pointers: next and previous
- previous node connects to the previous node in the linked list
- for the first node, head.prev = null, like tail.next = null
- Inserting new node at end, similar to singly linked list:
```python
tail.next = NewNode
NewNode.prev = tail
tail = tail.next
```
- Adding new node at start:
```python
head.prev = NewNode
NewNode.next = head
head = head.prev
```
- Removing a node - we can get prev node immediately
- Removing last element:
```python
tail.prev.next = null
tail = tail.prev
```
- Removing first element:
```python
head.next.prev = null
head = head.next
```
- Removing a node in the middle:
```python
curr.prev.next = curr.next
curr.next.prev = curr.prev
```
- Inserting/Removing is O(1)
- Searching/Accessing is still O(n)
- Stacks can be implemented with linked lists, but not done commonly. Use dynamic array for extra functionality
- Dynamic arrays are much more common and useful than linkedlists
