# Hash Usage

- Here, we talk about applications
- Sets and Maps can be implemented using Hash
- HashMaps are very useful, their avg time complexity beats TreeMap

| TreeMap  | HashMap | Operation |
|----------|---------|-----------|
| O(log n) | O(1)    | Insert    |
| O(log n) | O(1)    | Remove    |
| O(log n) | O(1)    | Search    |
| O(n)     | O(nlogn)| Inorder   |

- HashMaps don't maintain any kind of ordering, have to take all keys and sort
- HashMaps don't allow duplicates
```python
names = ["alice", "brad", "collin", "brad", "kim"]
countMap = {}
for name in names:
    if name not in countMap:
        countMap[name] = 1
    else:
        countMap[name] += 1
```
