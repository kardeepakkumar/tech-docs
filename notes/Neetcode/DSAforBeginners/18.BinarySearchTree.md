# Binary Search Tree

- Binary tree with a sorted property
- We could use them like a sorted array
- For every single node in the tree, all its left subtree nodes will be smaller than parent, and right subtree will be greater
- Generally, BST do not contain duplicates
- Can parse this tree efficiently to search for a value - 1 branch recursion
- Can search in O(logN) time, given our BST is roughly balanced
- We can say search time complexity: O(logH), where H is the height
- Balanced: For every single subtree, the height of left and right subtree differ by max 1
- Why use BST over sorted arrays?
  - Removing from array vs BST: O(n) vs O(logN)
  - Add a value in array vs BST: O(n) vs O(logN)
```python
def search(root, target):
    if not root:
        return False
    if(target > root.val):
        return search(root.right, target)
    elif(target < root.val):
        return search(root.left, target)
    else:
        return True
```
