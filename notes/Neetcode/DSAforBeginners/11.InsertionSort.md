# Insertion Sort

- There are many sorting algorithms, with different tradeoffs
- Not just for arrays, can be applied to linked lists as well
- Start with 1 element, sort it, and increase the size by 1 at a time
- We can do the above iteratively, using for and while loops
- We need to put the element in the right place, the time complexity for 1 element to be added in the sorted subarray is O(n)
- Time complexity: O(n^2)
- Best case time complexity: O(n)
- Space complexity: O(1)
```python
for i in range(1, len(arr)):
  j = i - 1
  while(j >= 0 and arr[j] > arr[j+1]):
    swap(arr[j], arr[j+1])
    j -= 1
```
- Stable vs Unstable sorting
  - Stable: same order of elements when there is a tie
  - Unstable: maybe different order of elements when there is a tie
- Insertion sort is stable
- Insertion sort is not used in real life applications
