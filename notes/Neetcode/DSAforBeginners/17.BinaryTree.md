# Binary Tree

- Similar to linked lists: node with values and pointers to other nodes
- Binary trees have 2 pointers: left and right
- Nodes have relationship: left child, right child and parent
- Left, right pointers could point to nodes or be null
- Nodes which don't have any children: leaf nodes
- Top node is called the root node
- Not allowed to have cycles
- Therefore, Binary trees are guaranteed to have leaf nodes
- Nodes which have same parent are called siblings
- We can't have siblings in same level also connecting with each other
- Every node is connected to other in a binary tree, no isolated node or group of nodes
- Height of a binary tree:
  - Height of a single node is 1 (sometimes defined 0)
  - We measure height starting from a node to its lowest descendent
- Descendant of a node is any child or great-x-grandchild of the node
- Ancestor is any node in the parent chain of a node
- Depth of a node is path from node to the root node
- Depth of root node is 1 (sometimes defined 0)

```python
def TreeNode:
  def __init__(self, val = 0, left = None, right = None):
    self.val = val
    self.left = left
    self.right = right

t = TreeNode(1)
```
