# Heap Properties

- Heap aka priority queue
- Instead of FIFO, some type of priority value
- Typically 2 variataions: minimum and maximum priority
- Interface is priority queue, implemented using a heap. But terms used interchangably
- Structure Property
  - A binary heap is a binary tree that is "complete"
  - A complete binary tree means every single level will be full, except possibly the last level
  - Values are added left to right, that is, last level will be filled from left
- Order Property
  - Need to find min/max really easily and quickly
  - Minimum value will be at the root(for min heap). Find it in O(1)
  - Recursively, every value in left and right subtree will be greater than node
  - Allowed to have duplicates
- Implemented under the hood using arrays
- We start with index 1, with root 1, and next level items from left to right
```python
leftChild = 2*i
rightChild = 2*i + 1
parent = i//2
```
