# Prim's Minimum spanning Tree

- Undirected Acyclical Connected graph
    - Undirected: Each edge means A->B and B->A
    - Acyclic: No cycles
    - Connected: There should be a connecting path from any node to any other node
- Minimum Spanning Tree: A subset of edges based on above criteria such that we minimise total cost
- For N nodes with acyclic connected: we always have N-1 edges
- There may be multiple minimum spanning tree for a graph
```python
# Time: O(E*logV)
# Space: O(E)
def minimumSpanningTree(edges, n):
    adj = {}
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        adj[i] = []
    for src, dst, weight in edges:
        adj[src].append([dst, weight])
        adj[dst].append([src, weight])
    minHeap = []
    for neighbor, weight in adj[1]:
        heapq.heappush(minHeap, [weight, 1, neighbor])
    mst = []
    visit = set()
    visit.add(1)
    while minHeap:
        weight, src, node = heapq.heappop(minHeap)
        if node in visit:
            continue
        mst.append([src, node])
        visit.add(node)
        for neighbor, weight in adj[node]:
            if neighbor not in visit:
                heapq.heappush(minHeap, [weight, node, neighbor])
    return mst
