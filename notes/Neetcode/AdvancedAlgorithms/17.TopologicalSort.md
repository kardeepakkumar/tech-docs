# Topological Sort

- A topological order is a sequence of nodes
- There may be multiple topologic order for a graph
- Topological order is only defined for Directed Acyclical Graph (DAG)
- Graph need not be connected though
- Given a graph, in its topological order, every source comes before the destination in the directed edge
- One way is to reverse the graph edges, and keep stack from edge starting nodes
- Or rather just reverse the order for current graph
```python
# Given a directed acyclical graph, return a valid topological order
def topologicalSort(edges, n):
    adj = {}
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        adj[i] = []
    for src, dst in edges:
        adj[src].append(dst)

    topSort = []
    visit = set()
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        dfs(i, adj, visit, topSort)
    topSort.reverse()
    return topSort

def dfs(src, adj, visit, topSort):
    if src in visit:
        return True
    visit.add(src)

    for neighbor in adj[src]:
        dfs(neighbor, adj, visit, topSort)
    topSort.append(src)
```
- If graph is not guaranteed acyclic, check for cycle detection: use a path set(), similar to visit, except pop after each dfs call
- Application of topologic sort: Course prerequisite
