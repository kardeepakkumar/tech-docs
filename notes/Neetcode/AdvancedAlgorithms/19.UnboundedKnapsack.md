# Unbounded Knapsack

- Given a list of N items, and a backpack with a limited capacity, return the maximum total profit that can be contained in the backpack. The i-th item's profit is profit[i] and it's weight is weight[i]. Assume you can have an unlimited number of each item available.

```python
# Brute force Solution
# Time: O(2^c)
# Space: O(c)

def dfs(profit, weight, capacity):
    return dfsHelper(0, profit, weight, capacity)

def dfsHelper(i, profit, weight, capacity):
    if i == len(profit):
        return 0
    
    # Exclude item i
    maxProfit = dfsHelper(i+1, profit, weight, capacity)

    # Include item i
    newCap = capacity - weight[i]
    if newCap >= 0:
        p = profit[i] + dfsHelper(i, profit, weight, newCap)
        maxProfit = max(maxProfit, p)
    return maxProfit
```

```python
# Memoization Solution
# Time: O(n*m)
# Space: O(n*m)
# Where n is the number of items & m is the capacity
def memoization(profit, weight, capacity):
    N, M = len(profit), capacity
    cache = [[-1]*(M+1) for _ in range(N)]
    return memoHelper(0, profit, weight, capacity, cache)

def memoHelper(i, profit, weight, capacity, cache):
    if i == len(profit):
        return 0
    if cache[i][capacity] != -1:
        return cache[i][capacity]

    # Exclude item i
    cache[i][capacity] = memoHelper(i+1, profit, weight, capacity, cache)

    # Include item i
    newCap = capacity - weight[i]
    if newCap >= 0:
        p = profit[i] + memoHelper(, profit, weight, newCap, cache)
        cache[i][capacity] = max(cache[i][capacity], p)
    return cahce[i][capacity]
```

```python
# DP Solution
# Time: O(n*m)
# Space: O(m)
def unbounded_knapsack(profit, weight, capacity):
    dp = [0] * (capacity + 1)
    for i in range(len(profit)):
        for c in range(weight[i], capacity + 1): 
            dp[c] = max(dp[c], dp[c - weight[i]] + profit[i])
    return dp[capacity]
