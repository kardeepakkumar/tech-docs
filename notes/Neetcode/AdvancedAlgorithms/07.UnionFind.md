# Union Find (Disjoint Sets)

- One or more connected components
- Union Find data structure helps count disjointed components, and checking for cycles
- Union Find is a forest of Trees
- Initially assume all nodes are disjoint
- Go through the edges and connect the nodes
- For each node, we just store a parent (initialised self-parent/None)
- Union by height/rank more efficient than arbitrary parenting
- Connect to the root of the larger tree
- Doesn't necessarily represent the graph connections accurately, rather the clusters
- Trying to connect 2 nodes which are already connected proves a cycle
- Ex: Given edges = [1,2], [4,1],[2,4] etc, and number of nodes
```python
class UnionFind:
    def __init__(self, n):
        self.par = {}
        self.rank = {}

        for i in range(1, n+1):
            self.par[i] = i
            self.rank[i] = 0

    def find(self, n):
        p = self.par[n]
        while p != self.par[p]:
            self.par[p] = self.par[self.par[p]] # path compression, optional optimisation O(n) -> O(logn)
            p = self.par[p]
        return p

    def union(self, n1, n2):
        p1, p2 = self.find(n1), self.find(n2)
        if p1 == p2:
            return False #Already same set

        if self.rank[p1] > self.rank[p2]: # Using rank -> O(alpha * n) Inverse Ackermann
            self.par[p2] = p1
        elif self.rank[p1] < self.rank[p2]:
            self.par[p1] = p2
        else:
            self.par[p1] = p2
            self.rank[p2] += 1
        return True
