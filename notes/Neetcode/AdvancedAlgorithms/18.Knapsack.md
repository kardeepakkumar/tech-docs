# 0/1 Knapsack

- 0/1 ~ Exclude/Include
- Ex: Given a list of N items, and a backpack with a limited capacity, return the maximum total profit that can be contained in the backpack. The ith item's profit is profit[i], and its weight is weight[i]. Each item can be added atmost once to the bag.

```python
# Brute Force Solution
# Time: O(2^n)
# Space: O(n)
# Where n is the number of times
def dfs(profit, weight, capacity):
    return dfsHelper(0, profit, weight, capacity)

def dfsHelper(i, profit, weight, capacity):
    if i == len(profit):
        return 0

    # exclude item i
    maxProfit = dfsHelper(i+1, profit, weight, capacity)

    # include item i
    newCap = capacity - weight[i]
    if newCap >= 0:
        p = profit[i] + dfsHelper(i+1, profit, weight, newCap)
        maxProfit = max(maxProfit, p)
    return maxProfit
```
```python
# Memoization Solution
# Time: O(n*m)
# Space: O(n*m)
def memoization(profit, weight, capacity):
    N, M = len(profit), capacity
    cache = [[-1]*(M+1) for _ in range(N)]
    return memoHelper(0, profit, weight, capacity, cache)

def memoHelper(i, profit, weight, capacity, cache):
    if i == len(profit):
        return 0
    if cache[i][capacity] != -1:
        return cache[i][capacity]

    # exclude item i
    cache[i][capacity] = memoHelper(i+1, profit, weight, capacity, cache)

    newCap = capacity - weight[i]
    if newCap >= 0:
        p = profit[i] + memoHelper(i+1, profit, weight, newCap, cache)
        cache[i][capacity] = max(cache[i][capacity], p)
    
    return cache[i][capacity]
```
```python
# DP Solution
# Time: O(n*m)
# Space: O(n*m) (can be O(n) if we just store one row)
def dp(profit, weight, capacity):
    N, M = len(profit), capacity
    dp = [[0]*(M+1) for _ in range(N)]
    for i in range(N):
        dp[i][0] = 0
    for c in range(M+1):
        if weight[0] <= c:
            dp[0][c] = profit[0]

    for i in range(1, N):
        for c in range(1, M+1):
            excluded = dp[i-1][c]
            included = 0
            if c - weight[i] >= 0:
                included = profit[i] + dp[i-1][c-weight[i]]
            dp[i][c] = max(included, excluded)
    return dp[N-1][M]
