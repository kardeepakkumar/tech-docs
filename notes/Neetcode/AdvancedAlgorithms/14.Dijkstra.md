# Dijkstra's lowest cost path

- Why we need Dijkstra beyond BFS?
- Dijkstra works well with weighted graphs
- Minimise cost along path from A -> B
- At each point, choose the shortest next path, as any other path to the node will be greater cost
- Use minHeap
- Ex: Starting from A, find the length of the shortest path to every other node. No weights are negative.
```python
# O(E*log(E)) ~ O(E*log(V))
def dijkstra(graph, startNode):
    minHeap = [(0, startNode)]
    shortestPaths = {}
    while minHeap:
        curCost, curTarget = heapq.heappop(minHeap)
        if curTarget in shortestPaths:
            continue
        shortestPaths[curTarget] = curCost
        for newTarget in graph[curTarget]:
            if newTarget not in shortestPaths:
                heapq.heappush(minHeap, (curCost + graph[curTarget][newTarget], newTarget))
    return shortestPaths
```
