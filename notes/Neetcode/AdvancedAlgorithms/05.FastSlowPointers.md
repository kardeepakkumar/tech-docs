# Fast and Slow Pointers

- aka Floyd's tortoise and hare algorithm
- Ex1: Find the middle of a linked list
```python
# O(n)
def midOfLinkedList(head):
    slow, fast = head, head
    while fast and fast.next:
        slow = slow.next
        fast = fast.next.next
    return slow
```

- Ex2: Determine if a linked list has a cycle
```python
# O(n)
def isCyclic(head):
    slow, fast = head, head
    while fast and fast.next:
        slow = slow.next
        fast = fast.next.next
        if slow == fast:
            return True
    return False
```

- Ex3: Determine if a linked list has a cycle and return the head
```python
# O(n)
def cycleStart(head):
    slow, fast = head, head
    while fast and fast.next:
        slow = slow.next
        fast = fast.next.next
        if slow == fast:
            break
    
    if not fast or not fast.next:
        return None

    slow2 = head
    while slow != slow2:
        slow = slow.next
        slow2 = slow2.next

    return slow
```
